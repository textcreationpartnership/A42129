            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <byline>By a Member of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p n="1">I. THAT Deans and Chapters are under the Penalty of a Premunire, forced to Elect Biſhops whomſoever the King ſhall name to them by his Mandate, how unfit ſoever they may be for that great Office in the Church; whereby, had the late King longer continued in the Government, all the Deans and Chapters in <hi>England</hi> muſt either have been undone, or elſe contrary to their conſciences and duty have Elected Papiſts upon the King's Command.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That Metropolitans are under the ſame Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Premunire to Conſecrate ſuch Biſhops to be Suffragans of their Provinces, as the King by his Mandate ſhall command, however unworthy they may be of the ſaid Office, whereby often a force is put upon the ſaid Metropolitans of Conſecrating ſuch as in their Conſciences they know will be a Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and Scandal to the Church, as was lately done in the Caſe of <hi>Cartwright</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> one of the greateſt Inſtances of Wickedneſs and Debauchery that this Church hath had ſince the Reformation.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That Biſhops are forced to ordain Perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to manage the Cure of Souls, the Law of the Land, which over-rules them in this particular, making ſuch mean qualifications ſufficient hereto, as were only allowed of in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, which by reaſon of the ſcarcity of fit Perſons to undertake Pariſh Cures on the terms of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then Eſtabliſhed, many were of neceſſity taken into the Miniſtry from Shops, and other Secular Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, who had never been put in a way of Education to qualifie them for it.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That Biſhops are forced by Writs of <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> to give Inſtitution to any ordained Miniſter, that comes to them with a Preſentation, how unfit ſoever he may appear for the charge he is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to; and ſo a neceſſity is often put upon them of Inveſting ſuch with the beſt Preferments of the Church, that are moſt undeſerving of them.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That the Preferments of the Church are of very different values, yet no diſtinction is made of the merits of men, or their degrees taken in Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, in the diſpoſal of them, but all are by Law e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually qualified for any place they can get to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to; whereas if all Eccleſiaſtical Proferments were diſtributed into ſeveral Claſſes, according to their value, and higher qualifications required to capacitate for thoſe that are higher in value: men would riſe in the Church only according to their merit and worth, and the worſt Men would not be ſo often found in the beſt Preferments.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That whereas Patrons are only Truſtees for God, and the Church, to find fit Perſons to preſent to the Biſhops to ſupply the Vacancies of ſuch Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings as are in their Preſentations, too many of them do moſt wickedly violate this truſt, to the diſhonour of God, and the great damage of the Church, by giving their ſaid Preſentations only to ſuch as will take them on Simonaical Contracts: whereby it comes to paſs, that only the worſt men, ſuch as will become guilty of ſo foul a Sin for the ſake of Secular intereſt get into the beſt preferments, while many good and Learned men, who cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Conſciences to ſuch baſe and wicked means of Advancement, are forced inſignificantly to wear out their time in Univerſities, and elſe-where, and the Church thereby become deprived of the labours of ſuch as are beſt able to be ſerviceable therein.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. That Papiſts are allowed to preſent to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, who being the bittereſt Enemies of our Church, make uſe of this truſt repoſed in them, to work it all the miſchief they can, not only prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the worſt men they can find to be a continual ſcandal thereto, but alſo for the moſt part, making ſuch Simonaical contracts with thoſe they preſent, as to reſerve out of all ſuch Livings Penſions for their Maſs Prieſts to Propagate their abominable Errours and Superſtitions amongſt us, to the great diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance both of Church and State.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. That whereas the deciſion of ſeveral Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, meerly Civil, are committed to Eccleſiaſtical Courts, they are allowed no other Soveraign Power but Excommunication only to enforce their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; whereby it comes to paſs, that often men are Excommunicated for Matters of Civil Right only, and ſometimes on very trivial occaſions, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters forced to Publiſh ſuch. Excommunications in their Churches, or elſe to be Excommunicated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the omiſſion; although ſometimes they are againſt the beſt living men in their Pariſhes, and procured againſt them only through the Fraud and Practice of Proctors, Advocates, and other Officers of Eccleſiaſtical Courts for the ſake of their own gain, the only thing theſe men look after.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. That all Eccleſiaſtical Power is by Law in a manner inveſted in lay Chancellors, and Officials, and Biſhops, and Arch-deacons, in whoſe Names they act, have nothing at all but the ſhaddow left them, whereby thoſe Governours of the Church are in a manner totally deprived of any Power to diſcharge their duties.</p>
            <p n="10">X. That the ſaid Biſhops and Arch-deacons have no ſufficient Power to call the ſaid Chancellors and Officials to account for any of their irregular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, by reaſon that their Places are by Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Free-holds; whereby it comes to paſs, that abundance of very illegal and oppreſſive acts are done in their names, of which they muſt bear all the blame, and yet have no power to remedy them.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. That the ſaid Chancellors and Officials have little or no regard to the Cannons of our Church, which ought to be the only Laws of their Courts, but break them as they think fit for their profit, whereby abundance of very enormous Crimes go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, and the whole Government of the Church, as far as relates to correction of Manners, and the promotion of Piety and Religion, is become totally inſignificant.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. That the ſaid Chancellors &amp; Officials make their Places for the moſt part <hi>ſine-Cures,</hi> never or ſeldom attending their Courts in Perſon, but committing them to the management of Surrogates, for the moſt part totally ignorant of their buſineſs, whereby all matters being uſually expedited by the direction of Regiſters, are too often ſo order'd and decreed, as will beſt conduce to advance their own profit, to the infinite oppreſſion of his Majeſties Subjects, and the great Scandal of the Church.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. That Arch-deacons are permitted to live out of their Dioceſſes in which their Juriſdictions lye; for Arch-Deacons being <hi>Oculi Epiſcopi,</hi> to be aſſiſting to Biſhops in the Government of the Dioceſs, ought always to be preſent within the Dioceſs to do their duties, eſpecially at Ordinations, where they are chiefly concerned to examine the Manners, Learning, and other Qualifications requiſite for thoſe that are to be admitted into the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. That there are in every Dioceſs ſo many Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars, whereby it comes to paſs, that the Miniſters of thoſe Peculiars being exempt from the ordinary juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the place where they live, and in a manner alſo from all others, (thoſe to whom the ſaid Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiars belong, ſeldom taking any care of them) often take upon them to do very irregular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant things, eſpecially in the caſe of Clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Marriages, and think they have Authority ſo to do; becauſe they lye not within the uſual methods of being called to account and puniſhed for them.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. That Market Towns and Cities, where is moſt need of Able Miniſters, are the worſt provided
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100939:2"/>
with a maintenance for them, of any places in the Nation, whereby it comes to paſs, that thoſe places being uſually ſerved by men unfit for the charge they there undertake, ill deſigning men take the advantage of it, and for want of able Shepherds to defend thoſe Flocks, have too ſucceſsfully invaded them with their Errours, to the great diſturbance both of Church and State.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. That Preſcriptions <hi>&amp; modi decimandi</hi> grow too much in evry Pariſh, whereby the maintenance of Miniſters is not only endangered in a great part to be loſt, but alſo ſuch a Bone of Contention is thereby thrown in between the Miniſter and his Pariſhioners, as to make his Miniſtry often totally ineffectual among them. Whereas, were there a Regiſter in every Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of all Preſcriptions <hi>&amp; modi decimandi,</hi> as are truly and legally ſuch, the whole of this would be prevented, and Pariſhioners living in better correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with their Miniſters, would be better diſpos'd to be directed and inſtructed by them in all thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Chriſtianity, which it is their duty and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to guide them into.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. That there is no Law to force Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to allow a competency for the ſerving of thoſe Cures they are to provide for; but the ſaid Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priators receiving the whole income of the Benefice, and being left at their own diſcretion for the provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Curate, often either provide none at all, or elſe ſuch inſufficient ones as the Pariſhioners can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no benefit from them, to the great diſhonour of God, the Scandal of the Church, and the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able damage of thoſe People who ſuffer thereby.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. That Miniſters have no power to force Maſters of Families to bring their Children and Servants to be Catechiz'd, through want of which, one of the moſt uſeful methods of Inſtruction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, in a manner, totally omitted in our Church.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. That Miniſters are liable to have Actions brought againſt them at Law, for refuſing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to thoſe whom they know to be of ſuch Scandalous Lives and Converſations, as to be utterly unworthy to be admitted thereto.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. That the method of depriving Scandalous Miniſters, is according to Law ſo tedious and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, through multitude of Appeals, as in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be impracticable, and thereby the Church lies under the Scandal of tolerating them, when it is not in her power to help it.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. That whereas Compurgation is allow'd in Law for a ſufficient acquittal from ſome Crimes, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Miniſters that are guilty of them avoid the puniſhment, by getting others as bad as themſelves to be their Compurgators, to acquit them of them, and thereby fruſtrate all courſe of Juſtice againſt them.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. That, whereas ſuch as are deſigned for the Miniſtry, ought to be bred up not only in the ſtudy of good Learning, but alſo with their Inclinations continually framed to Piety and ſober living; that when they are called forth into the ſervice of the Church, they may not only have Abilities, but alſo ſincere, and truly Religious purpoſes of Heart faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to diſcharge the Duties they undertake. The Diſcipline of the Univerſities is ſo remiſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, as to have no regard at all hereto, as take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no care to have the young Scholars inſtructed in Religion and Piety, nor by no means uſing that caution which is ſufficient to ſecure their Morals, but permits them to a Looſe, Vain, and Licentious kind of living; allowing them to frequent Alehouſes and Taverns, and other places of common Debauchery, which too many there accuſtoming themſelves to, cannot forſake them all their lives after; whereas, were it made ſcandalous in Univerſities to frequent thoſe Houſes, by affixing on it the penalty of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion (as in reaſon it ought) and Scholars were kept ſtrictly to their Colledges, and accuſtomed to Piety and Religion, as well as the ſtudy of Arts and Sciences, they would come from thoſe places, when called forth of them to take care of Souls, ſo fenced by Cuſtome and Education, againſt all thoſe irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar courſes of living, which make ſo many of our Clergy Scandalous, as by the aſſiſtance of God's Grace, they would be able to live free from them all their lives after; and ſo become a guide to their People, not only by the Doctrines that they teach them, but alſo by the Examples which they will put them, in living Soberly and Religiouſly among them. And this is a matter of that moment as may deſerve to be well conſidered and look'd into: for if you will have the Streams clean from puddle, you muſt be ſure to make them run clear at the Fountain; and therefore, if ever you will throughly reform the lives of the Clergy, you muſt be ſure to begin at the Univerſities, the Fountains from which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; for thoſe corruptions of life and manners which are ſo much complain'd of in too many of our Clergy, if inquir'd into, will be all found to proceed from a Taint receiv'd in their firſt Education.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. That the Univerſities, eſpecially <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> give Degrees in Divinity to ſuch as do not perform their Excerciſes for them, only taking Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary Bonds that they ſhall perform them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which are now for the moſt part, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſcharged, than by paying the forfeiture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Conſtitution of the Univerſity being baſely vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and betray'd, thoſe Degrees become proſtituted for Money, to Men by no means deſerving of them, who by this means reaping thoſe Honours which are due only to Learning and Merit, by virtue of them become often recommended to ſuch preferments as they are by no means qualify'd for.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. That Convocations are made totally uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, they being prohibited to debate of any thing, how much ſoever the Corruptions of the Church may require it, unleſs the King propoſeth it unto them, and that under the ſevere penalty of a <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire;</hi> whereby it hath come to paſs, that for twenty four years in the two laſt Reigns, tho' Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations were always called, nothing was at all done in them, but Clergy-men have been forc'd to take long Journeys from all parts of the Nation to meet in thoſe Convocations, with great Expence and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to no end and purpoſe: Whereas, were it left to the Convocation to examine and enquire into the Corruptions of the Church from time to time, as the Parliament doth into thoſe of the State, ſuch cautions for remedy thereof might have been offered to the Royal Aſſent as might have prevented all that Trouble and Confuſion which now the Church is fallen into for want thereof; and alſo ſuch Clergy-men as are of an higher Station than the ordinary Courts can well reach, might in thoſe Aſſemblies be call'd to cenſure for any Irregularities they ſhould commit, and the Peace, and good Order of the Church be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſerved thereby.</p>
            <p>And would it pleaſe the King's Majeſty, and the two Houſes of Parliament, that the Church may again be reſtor'd to the Ancient Right; no better method can be propos'd to cure all its Diſtractions at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and keep it for the future from all thoſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, which otherwiſe from time to time it muſt neceſſarily fall into.</p>
            <p>And theſe particulars being thus carefully and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially laid together, are offered to the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the preſent Parliament, humbly beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, in the name of the Clergy of this Church, that ſince moſt of the things now objected to us, as Defects and Corruptions among us, proceed all from thoſe above mentioned Grievances, which we have no power to remedy; they would rather look on them as our Infelicities than our Faults, and would be pleas'd by their Wiſdom to find out ſuch Methods, and enact ſuch Laws as may enable us to redreſs them; and then, if all the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders now complain'd of amongſt us, be not totally amended, we will freely confeſs the fault is ours.</p>
